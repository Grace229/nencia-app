          Nencia aims to connect African fashion brands with the global market.
          To create a network of designers and small businesses who are
          passionate about their work but face barriers at every turn. We want
          them all to have access to the tools they need tech-driven
          infrastructure like logistics so they'll never have to worry about
          whether or not their creative designs are going anywhere because of
          where they live.
